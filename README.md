### A structure in which Main.js calls functions in order. 



1)  LoadWorld

```
 Designation of sky blue (setClearColor), creation of a perspective camera looking at the plane, and creation of a world (whole map) gravitational with CanonJS-(gravity is the value we set in configJS).
```



2)  loadPlane

```
Calling the AddPlane function: Adding a kite model to the World.
Import 3d kites modeled directly into Sketch up.
CannonJS sets the weight of the kite, air resistance and starting position.
```



3) else . . .
